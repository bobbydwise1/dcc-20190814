# Daily Coding Problem 2019-08-14

####  _Good morning! Here's your coding interview problem for today._

_This problem was asked by Microsoft._

_Compute the running median of a sequence of numbers. That is, given a stream of numbers, print out the median of the list so far on each new element._

_Recall that the median of an even-numbered list is the average of the two middle numbers._

_For example, given the sequence_

    [2, 1, 5, 7, 2, 0, 5],

_your algorithm should print out:_

    2
    1.5
    2
    3.5
    2
    2
